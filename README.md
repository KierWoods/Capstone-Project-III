# Capstone-Project-III

## Description 
Task Manager application for a user toview, add, manage tasks assigned to various users.
users can also log in to view their own tasks. 
the application is written in pytrhon. 

the purpose of this application was to further my knowledge in reading and writing from files, adding user defined functions in python.

## Requiremments

1. Python IDE, i.e VSCode or other
2. download task_manager.py
3. download users.txt and tasks.txt
4. download users_overview.txt and task_overview.txt
5. store all files in the same folder.

## How to use

log in as admin for full access as defined in the prior project,

new functions added: 

● When the user chooses to generate reports, two text files, called
task_overview.txt and user_overview.txt, should be generated. Both
these text files should output data in a user-friendly, easy to read manner.
o task_overview.txt should contain:
▪ The total number of tasks that have been generated and
tracked using the task_manager.py.
▪ The total number of completed tasks.
▪ The total number of uncompleted tasks.
▪ The total number of tasks that haven’t been completed and
that are overdue.
▪ The percentage of tasks that are incomplete.
▪ The percentage of tasks that are overdue.
o user_overview.txt should contain:
▪ The total number of users registered with task_manager.py.
▪ The total number of tasks that have been generated and
tracked using the task_manager.py.
▪ For each user also describe:
▪ The total number of tasks assigned to that user.
▪ What percentage of the total number of tasks have
been assigned to that user?
▪ What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user
have been completed?
▪ What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user
must still be completed?
▪ What percentage of the tasks assigned to that user
have not yet been completed and are overdue?
● Modify the menu option that allows the admin to display statistics so that
the reports generated are read from task_overview.txt and
user_overview.txt and displayed on the screen in a user-friendly manner.

These functions create and write task and user data to txt files. these can be accessed for future use and added to when appropriate.
